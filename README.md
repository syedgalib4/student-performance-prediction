# Student Performance Prediction

## Objective
To build a simple logistic regression model that predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on study hours and attendance.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn
- Google Colab

## Dataset
A manually created dataset with columns:
- Hours_Studied
- Attendance (%)
- Pass/Fail (1 = Pass, 0 = Fail)

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells.
3. Modify input to test different values using `.predict()`.
